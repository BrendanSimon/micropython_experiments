"""
LED fade/flash example using asyncio.

This example continually fades a LED on and off, and switches to a
quicker flash for a small period when a button is pressed.

The LED and BUTTON objects are imported from the board/hardware config module.
You need to copy the config file for your board to a suitable location.

Tested on the Olimex E407 board, which has one LED and one button.
See `examples/hwapi/hwconfig_OLIMEX_E407.py` for an example config module

This example was extended from LED fade example using asyncio
